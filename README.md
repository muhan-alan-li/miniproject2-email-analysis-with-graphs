  - wrote method that utilises a modified depth-first search in order find the number of connected nodes from a given starting node within a time period
- **General code upkeep**
  - Ensuring proper line, method, class, and branch coverage with tests
  - Writing specification, abstraction function, and rep invariants for methods and classes

A more detailed account of contributions exist in the form of the three CONTRIB-(github_username).md files
